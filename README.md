# Saving Corgon
> Saving Corgon is a game developed by Development Team Delta from Servant Engineering, aimed at teaching elementary school students about sustainability, conservation, and circular economy. The game follows an alien character who crash lands on Earth and must overcome sustainability challenges in a 3D side-scrolling world. The game also includes real-life field trips and at-home projects related to STEAM to enhance the learning experience.

## Development Period
January 9 to May 1

## Design Goals
> The main design goal for the computer science side of the project is to create at least 2 working levels, including game metrics and mechanics, music, art, visuals, and communication with the world around us.

## Influences & Inspirations
> The game is inspired by 8-bit side scrollers like Mario, Megaman, and Sonic. It also takes inspiration from Lego StarWars, where players have to unlock items to access parts of the game that are unavailable through the first pass.

## Target Market
The game is designed for late elementary school students who are homeschooling.

## Elevator Pitch
> Saving Corgon is a 2D side scroller designed to teach elementary school aged homeschoolers about sustainability and circular economy. The game is paired with both a physical activity and a field trip for students to learn with their guardians.

## Functional Specifications
The core gameplay mechanics of Saving Corgon include:

- Moving around the 2D environment
- Picking up/throwing items in a certain area
- Gaining points from collecting and throwing away items in the correct areas

## Detailed Design Doc
> Saving Corgon takes a three-pronged approach to teaching upper elementary students about circular economy and sustainability. The game is paired with an at-home activity and a field trip type activity to enhance the learning experience.

> The first level of the game focuses on recycling plastic water bottles. Players must collect stray plastic water bottles as quickly as possible to recycle them properly. The in-home activity for this level involves repurposing a plastic water bottle into a bird feeder using the given instructions. For the field trip, the student will visit a bottle drop to see how they can earn money by recycling and how the whole system works.

> In addition to level by level at-home activities, students will build a heat engine from a kit provided by the game. The heat engine will connect to the game through an Arduino, allowing students to earn in-game currency and learn about circular economy.
